    <p>
        This page lists some of the games that I have built.
        <br>
        Most of the games on this page were written in Java
        <br>
        using the libGDX framework.
        <br>
        <br>
        I plan on including some simple JavaScript 
        <br>
        games on this page soon!

    <p>
    "Tank Game" is similar to the "Tanks!" minigame featured in "Wii Play."
    
    <br>
    <br>
    The plan for the first iteration is to have a single player
    try to destroy enemy tanks while avoiding incoming fire 
    and other obstacles.

    <br>
    <br>
    The game features a top-down perspective and aiming input provided
    by the mouse cursor
    <br>
    <br>
    This is my first attempt at a 3D game using the Unity engine!
    It is a work in progress, but I am having fun as I get it
    to completion!

    <p>
    "Pong" is a clone of the popular 1972 Atari game of the same name.
    <br>
    This version of "Pong" is written in libGDX using Java, and can be played
    against the computer, or a friend on the same device.

<div class="preview">
    <img src="JumpySquare.PNG" class = "thumbnail"></img>
    <p>
        "Jumpy Square" is a clone of the popular 2013 mobile game "Flappy bird"
        <br>
        "Jumpy Square" is another game written using the libGDX framework.
        <br>
        The game is pretty tricky, but hopefully you can reach
        a new high score!
